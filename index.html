                <p><small>Coding is important to learn because computer programming teaches children to experiment and
                        gives them the confidence to be creative. They will have the chance to design something that is
                        entirely their own. Children thrive off of the feedback they get from creating something they
                        love.</small></p>

                <p><small>Coronavirus â€“ COVID 19 disease causes a respiratory infection in humans. The evidence of
                        Coronavirus was found in the year 1965 for the first time. But it was 17 November 2019 when a
                        lady of 55 years was found infected with this deadly virus in China.

                        The virus lasts only for 14 days in a human body and can also kill the person depending on his
                        immune system. The early symptoms can be detected just after 4 days of getting infected. So,
                        take care of yourself and of your family and follow all the precautions carefully. Near about
                        37.4Million people have infected till now in the entire world and more than 10,77,082 deaths
                        have been registered.</small></p>
